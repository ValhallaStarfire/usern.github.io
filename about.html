      <div class="about-content">
        <p>I'm Nichole, a.k.a., Princess Snapback. With the help of my boyfriend Ryan, a.k.a., Sir Snapback, I act as the main web developer for this website. When the snapbacks come off, we're just a loving couple living together in our apartment. This is mostly a passion project, so you can be sure that a lot of love and hard work goes into each video we upload. And as a standard of quality, we don't upload a video if we're not having fun. With our friends on their own channels, my dream is to form a syndicate of imaginative and devoted content creators called Idiots, Inc. So grab a snapback and let's see where this adventure takes us!</p>
